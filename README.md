I made a bump mapping shader and modified it to take in a colour pass in the fragment shader.
I applied this shader to the terrain of the level so that it enhances the look of the terrain while adding more detail to it.

I also the water shader and then modified it so it to in a second texture will pass through and then adjusted the the base colour's vibrance.
I then applied it to a plane to act as the water that matches the look of the reference image while enhancing the graphical quality of it.
